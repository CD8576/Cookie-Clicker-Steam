# Authentication

Authentication APIs provide utilities to authenticate a Steam user's identity
and verify ownership of an application.

**Note:** Authentication APIs are required an extra dynamic library. Please copy
`sdkencryptedappticket.dll`/`libsdkencryptedappticket.dylib`/`libsdkencryptedappticket.so`
from Steamworks SDK (`<steam_sdk-path>/public/steam/lib/`) to your application
directory `<greenworks>/lib`.

```javascript
var greenworks = require('./greenworks');

greenworks.init();

greenworks.getEncryptedAppTicket('test_content', function(ticket) {
  console.log("ticket: " + ticket.toString('hex'));
  // Specify the secret key.
  var key = new Buffer(32);
  // TODO: you must initialize Buffer key with the secret key of your game here,
  // e.g. key = new Buffer([0x0a, ..., 0x0b]).
  assert(key.length == greenworks.EncryptedAppTicketSymmetricKeyLength)
  var decrypted_app_ticket = greenworks.decryptAppTicket(ticket, key);
  if (decrypted_app_ticket) {
    console.log(greenworks.isTicketForApp(decrypted_app_ticket,
                greenworks.getAppId()));
    console.log(greenworks.getTicketAppId(decrypted_app_ticket));
    console.log(greenworks.getTicketSteamId(decrypted_app_ticket));
    console.log(greenworks.getTicketIssueTime(decrypted_app_ticket));
  }
}, function(err) { throw err; });
```

## Methods

### greenworks.getAuthSessionTicket(success_callback, [error_callback])

* `success_callback` Function(ticket)
  * `ticket` Object:
    * `ticket` Buffer:  The `ticket` value.
    * `handle` Integer: The `handle` value returned from the ticket.
* `error_callback` Function(err)

Retrieve ticket to be sent to the entity who wishes to authenticate you.

The `ticket` buffer can be used like `ticket.toString('hex')` for the Web API
`ISteamUserAuth/AuthenticateUserTicket` to securely obtain an authenticated
Steam ID from your game server. The `handle` is needed to invalidate the ticket
after if it has not been used.

Note that the tickets generated by this function become invalid once the process
that creates them dies. If you are creating tickets in some temporary processes,
make sure that these tickets stay alive until authentication is over!

### greenworks.cancelAuthTicket(ticket_handle)

* `ticket_handle` Integer: The `handle` value returned from the ticket.

Invalidates a requested session ticket.

### greenworks.getEncryptedAppTicket(user_data, success_callback, [error_callback])

* `user_data` String: Arbitrary data that will be encrypted into the ticket.
  This will be utf-8 encoded when stored in the ticket.
* `success_callback` Function(encrypted_ticket)
  * `encrypted_ticket` Buffer: The encrypted ticket.
* `error_callback` Function(err)

Encrypted tickets can be used to obtain authenticated Steam IDs from clients
without requiring network requests to Steam's API servers. These tickets can be
decrypted using your Encrypted App Ticket Key. Once decrypted, the user's
Steam ID, App ID, and VAC ban status can be read from the ticket using the
Steamworks Encrypted App Ticket library provided in the SDK.

### greenworks.decryptAppTicket(encrypted_ticket, decryption_key)

* `encrypted_ticket` Buffer: The encrypted ticket.
* `decryption_key` Buffer: The secret key for decryption. The length of the key
  should be `greenworks.EncryptedAppTicketSymmetricKeyLength`.

Decrypt the encrypted app ticket with your decryption key. Returns a `Buffer`
represents the decrypted ticket if succeeds; otherwise returns a `Null`.

### greenworks.isTicketForApp(decrypted_ticket, app_id)

* `decrypted_ticket` Buffer: The decrypted ticket.
* `app_id` Integer: The id for the app.

Returns a `Boolean` indicates whether the decrypted ticket is for the app.

### greenworks.getTicketIssueTime(decrypted_ticket)

* `decrypted_ticket` Buffer: The decrypted ticket.

Returns an `Integer` represents the ticket issue time.

### greenworks.getTicketSteamId(decrypted_ticket)

* `decrypted_ticket` Buffer: The decrypted ticket.

Returns an [`SteamID`](friends.md#steamid) object represents the steam id of the
ticket.

### greenworks.getTicketAppId(decrypted_ticket)

* `decrypted_ticket` Buffer: The decrypted ticket.

Returns an `Integer` represents app id of the ticket.
